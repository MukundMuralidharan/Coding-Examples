TO run the application please go to DoctorAppEntry and start.

Just to make the process simple i have added a scanner to get the doctor's name so you will be asked to 
enter the doctor's name to be searched for similar type.

I have created a CSV file to get the doctor information.

I have created a Test folder that has the unit test 

Total time to code this application was 45 minutes and i went one step ahead in created readme file which 
took an additional 10 minutes and wanted to be sure of all the validation so that took another 5 minutes.
So in total i spent about 1 hr for this application.
